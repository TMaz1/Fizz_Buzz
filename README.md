# Fizz_Buzz
A programming task completed in Python, Haskell, C and C++

FizzBuzzTest
Task: print out the numbers 1 to 100
If a number is divisible by 3 then your program should print ‘Fizz’. If a number is divisible by 5 then your program should print ‘Buzz’. 
If a number is divisible by both 5 and 3 (e.g., 15) then your program should print ‘FizzBuzz’


This exercise is written in different programming paradigms.
1.	Python
2.	C (Procedural Paradigm)
3.	C++ (Object Oriented Paradigm)
4.	Haskell (Functional Paradigm)


NOTE:
Programming paradigm: a style/way of programming

Procedural paradigm:
•   Every written is a procedure: set of instructions
Object-oriented paradigm:
•   Everything is an object with specific properties and behaviour relating to a class
Functional paradigm:
•   Everything you write is a function
•	Program solves the problem: joining the functions
